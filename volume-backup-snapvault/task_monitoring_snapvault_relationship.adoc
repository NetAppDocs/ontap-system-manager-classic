You should periodically monitor the status of the SnapVault relationships to ensure that the data is backed up on the destination volume per the specified schedule.

.About this task

You must perform this task from the *destination* cluster.

.Steps

. Depending on the System Manager version that you are running, perform one of the following steps:
 ** ONTAP 9.4 or earlier: Click *Protection* > *Relationships*.
 ** Beginning with ONTAP 9.5: Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the SnapVault relationship between the source and the destination volumes, and then verify the status in the *Details* bottom tab.
+
The health status of the SnapVault relationship, any transfer errors, and the lag time are displayed:

 ** The Is Healthy field must display `Yes`.
+
For most data transfer failures, the field displays `No`. In some failure cases, however, the field continues to display `Yes`. You must check the transfer errors in the Details section to ensure that no data transfer failure occurred.

 ** The Relationship State field must display `Snapmirrored`.
 ** The Lag Time must be not more than the transfer schedule interval.
+
For example, if the transfer schedule is daily, then the lag time must not be more than a day.
+
You should troubleshoot any issues in the SnapVault relationships. The troubleshooting procedures for SnapMirror relationships are also applicable to SnapVault relationships.
