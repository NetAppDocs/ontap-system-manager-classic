[.lead]
Using the ONTAP System Manager classic interface (ONTAP 9.7 and earlier), you can quickly set up both SMB and NFS access to a new volume on either a new or existing storage virtual machine (SVM).

Use this procedure if you want to configure access to a volume in the following way:

* NFS access will be through NFSv3, not NFSv4 or NFSv4.1.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* Your data network uses the default IPspace, the default broadcast domain, and the default failover group.
+
If your data network is flat, using these default objects ensures that LIFs will fail over correctly in the event of a link failure. If you are not using the default objects, you should refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/index.html[Network Management^] for information on how to configure LIF path failover.

* LDAP, if used, is provided by Active Directory.

If you want details about the range of ONTAP NFS and SMB protocol capabilities, see the following documentation:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-admin/index.html[NFS management^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smb-admin/index.html[SMB management^]
