Before you provision a volume to contain your LUNs, you need to decide whether to add the volume to an existing storage virtual machine (SVM) or to create a new SVM for the volume. You might also need to configure iSCSI on an existing SVM.

.About this task

If an existing SVM is already configured with the needed protocols and has LIFs that can be accessed from the host, it is easier to use the existing SVM.

You can create a new SVM to separate data or administration from other users of the storage cluster. There is no advantage to using separate SVMs just to separate different protocols.

== Procedure

* If you want to provision volumes on an SVM that is already configured for iSCSI, you must verify that the iSCSI service is running and then create a LUN on the SVM.

* If you want to provision volumes on an existing SVM that has iSCSI enabled but not configured, configure iSCSI on the existing SVM.

This is the case when you did not follow this procedure to create the SVM while configuring a different protocol.

* If you want to provision volumes on a new SVM, create the SVM.
