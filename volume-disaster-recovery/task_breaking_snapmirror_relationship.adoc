You must quiesce and break the SnapMirror relationship to activate the destination volume. After quiescing, future SnapMirror data transfers are disabled.

.Before you begin

The destination volume must be mounted on the destination SVM namespace.

.About this task

You must perform this task from the *destination* cluster.

.Steps

. Depending on the System Manager version that you are running, perform one of the following steps:
 ** ONTAP 9.4 or earlier: Click *Protection* > *Relationships*.
 ** Beginning with ONTAP 9.5: Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the SnapMirror relationship between the source and the destination volumes.
. Click *Operations* > *Quiesce* to disable future data transfers.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Quiesce*.
+
The quiesce operation might take some time; you must not perform any other operation on the SnapMirror relationship until the transfer status is displayed as `Quiesced`.

. Click *Operations* > *Break*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Break*.
