This topic applies to ONTAP 9.7 or earlier. You might have to remove a faulty NIC from its slot or move the NIC to another slot for maintenance purposes.

.Before you begin

* All LIFs hosted on the NIC ports must have been migrated or deleted.
* None of the NIC ports can be the home ports of any LIFs.
* You must have advanced privileges to delete the ports from a NIC.

.Steps

. Delete the ports from the NIC:
+
`network port delete`

. Verify that the ports have been deleted:
+
`network port show`

. Repeat step 1, if the output of the network port show command still shows the deleted port.
