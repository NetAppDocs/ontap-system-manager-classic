[.lead]
You can move all of the ports from one broadcast domain into an existing broadcast domain using the merge command.

This operation reduces the steps required if you were to remove all ports from a broadcast domain and then add the ports to an existing broadcast domain.

.Step

Merge the ports from one broadcast domain into an existing broadcast domain:

....
network port broadcast-domain merge -ipspace <ipspace_name> -broadcast-domain <broadcast_domain_name> -into-broadcast-domain <broadcast_domain_name>
....

* `ipspace_name` is the name of the IPspace where the broadcast domains reside.
* `-broadcast-domain` is the name of the broadcast domain that will be merged.
* `-into-broadcast-domain` is the name of the broadcast domain that will receive additional ports.

.Example

The following example merges broadcast domain bd-data1 into broadcast domain bd-data2:

`network port -ipspace Default broadcast-domain bd-data1 into-broadcast-domain bd-data2`
