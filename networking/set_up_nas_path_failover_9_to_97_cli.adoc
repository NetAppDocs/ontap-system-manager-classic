This workflow guides you through the networking configuration steps to set up NAS path failover for ONTAP 9.0 - 9.7. This workflow assumes the following:

* You want to use NAS path failover best practices that simplify network configuration.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager.
* You are configuring networking on a new system running ONTAP 9.0 to 9.7.

If you are running an ONTAP release later than 9.7, you should use the NAS path failover procedure for ONTAP 9.8 or later:

If you want details about network components and management, you should use the network management reference material:
