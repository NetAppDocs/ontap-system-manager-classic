You can display the list of broadcast domains within each IPspace in a cluster. The output also shows the list of ports and the MTU value for each broadcast domain.

.Step

Display the broadcast domains and associated ports in the cluster:

....
network port broadcast-domain show
....

The following command displays all the broadcast domains and associated ports in the cluster:

....
network port broadcast-domain show

                           cluster-1-01:e0d       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0c       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0d       complete

                           cluster-1-01:e0e       complete
                           cluster-1-01:e0f       complete
                           cluster-1-01:e0g       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0e       complete

                           cluster-1-02:e0g       complete

The following command displays the ports in the bcast1 broadcast domain that have an update status of error, which indicate that the port could not be updated properly:

....
network port broadcast-domain show -broadcast-domain bcast1 -port-update-status error
