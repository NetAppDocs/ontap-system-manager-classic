You can quickly restore a volume from a SnapVault backup in ONTAP when there is a data loss.

Use this procedure if you want to restore from the vault backup in the following way:

* You are working with clusters running ONTAP 9.
* You are a cluster administrator.
* You have configured the vault relationship following the procedure described in xref:../volume-backup-snapvault/index.html[Volume backup using SnapVault]

* You do not want to perform a single file or LUN restore.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use the System Manager classic interface for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.

If these assumptions are not correct for your situation, or if you want more conceptual background information, you should see the following resource:
