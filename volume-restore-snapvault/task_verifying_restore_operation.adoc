After performing the restore operation from the SnapVault backup destination volume, you must verify the status of the restore operation on the source cluster.

.About this task

You must perform this task from the *source* cluster.

.Steps

. Navigate to the *Volumes* window.
. Select the source volume in the volumes list and perform one of the following actions, depending on your ONTAP version:
 ** Beginning with ONTAP 9.3: Double-click the source volume to view the details, and then click *PROTECTION* to identify the destination volume in the SnapMirror relationship and the name of the SVM that contains the volume.
 ** ONTAP 9.2 or earlier: Click the *Data Protection* bottom tab to identify the destination volume in the SnapMirror relationship and the name of the SVM that contains the volume.
The Type field displays `Restore` temporarily. After the restore operation is completed, the field displays `Vault`.
