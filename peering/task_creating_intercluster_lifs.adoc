summary: "Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, until ONTAP 9.7, you can use the ONTAP System Manager 'classic' interface to create intercluster logical interfaces (LIFs), which enable the cluster network to communicate with a node. You must create an intercluster LIF within each IPspace that will be used for peering, on each node in each cluster for which you want to create a peer relationship."

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, until ONTAP 9.7, you can use the ONTAP System Manager _classic_ interface to create intercluster logical interfaces (LIFs), which enable the cluster network to communicate with a node. You must create an intercluster LIF within each IPspace that will be used for peering, on each node in each cluster for which you want to create a peer relationship.

.About this task

For example, if you have a four-node cluster that you want to peer with cluster X over IPspace A, and peer with cluster Y over IPspace Y, then you need a total of eight intercluster LIFs; Four on IPspace A (one per node), and four on IPspace Y (one per node).

You must perform this procedure on both clusters for which you want to create a peer relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Configuration* > *Advanced Cluster Setup*.
. In the *Setup Advanced Cluster Features* window, click *Proceed* next to the *Cluster Peering* option.
. Select an IPspace from the *IPspace* list.
. Enter the IP address, port, network mask, and gateway details of each node.

. Click *Submit and Continue*.

== What to do next

You should enter the cluster details in the Cluster Peering window to continue with cluster peering.
