Using the ONTAP System Manager _classic_ interface with ONTAP 9.2 or an earlier ONTAP 9 release, you can create SVM peer relationships.

A peer relationship defines network connections that enable clusters and SVMs to exchange data securely. You must create a cluster peer relationship before you can create an SVM peer relationship.
