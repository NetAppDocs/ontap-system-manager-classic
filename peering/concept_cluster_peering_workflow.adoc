You can set up a peering relationship by using the ONTAP System Manager with ONTAP 9.7 or earlier.
Setting up a peering relationship involves preparing each cluster for peering, creating intercluster logical interfaces (LIFs) on each node of each cluster, setting up a cluster peer relationship, and then setting up an SVM peering relationship.
