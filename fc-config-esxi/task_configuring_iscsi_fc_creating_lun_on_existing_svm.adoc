You can configure FC on an existing storage virtual machine (SVM). The FC protocol must already be enabled but not configured on the SVM. This information is intended for SVMs for which you are configuring multiple protocols, but have not yet configured FC.

.Before you begin

Your FC fabric must be configured and the desired physical ports must be connected to the fabric.

.Steps

. Navigate to the *SVMs* window.
. Select the SVM that you want to configure.
. In the SVM**Details** pane, verify that *FC/FCoE* is displayed with a gray background, which indicates that the protocol is enabled but not fully configured.
+
If *FC/FCoE* is displayed with a green background, the SVM is already configured.

. Click the *FC/FCoE* protocol link with the gray background.
+
The Configure FC/FCoE Protocol window is displayed.

. Configure the FC service and LIFs from the *Configure FC/FCoE protocol* page:
 .. Select the *Configure Data LIFs for FC* check box.
 .. Enter `2` in the *LIFs per node* field.
+
Two LIFs are required for each node, to ensure availability and data mobility.

 .. Ignore the optional *Provision a LUN for FCP storage* area, because the LUN is provisioned by Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere in a later step.
 .. Click *Submit & Close*.
. Review the *Summary* page, record the LIF information, and then click *OK*.
