You can use the ONTAP System Manager _classic_ interface with ONTAP 9.7 or earlier to test SNMP traps. Because communication with a traphost is not automatically validated when you add it, you should verify that the SNMP traphost can correctly receive traps.

.Steps

. Navigate to the *SNMP* screen.
. Click *Test Trap Host* to generate a trap from the cluster in which you added a traphost.
. From the traphost location, verify that the trap was received.
+
Use whatever software you ordinarily use to manage the SNMP traphost.
