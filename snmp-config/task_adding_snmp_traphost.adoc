You can use the ONTAP System Manager _classic_ interface with ONTAP 9.7 or earlier to  add a traphost (SNMP manager) to receive SNMP notifications (SNMP trap protocol data units) when traps are generated in the cluster.

.Before you begin

IPv6 must be enabled on the cluster if you configure SNMP traphosts that have IPv6 addresses.

.About this task

SNMP and SNMP traps are enabled by default. The NetApp Technical Report TR-4220 on SNMP support contains lists of all default events that are supported by SNMP traps.

.Steps

. In the SNMP window, click *EDIT* to open the *Edit SNMP Settings* dialog box.
. [[step2-verify-enable-traps]]In the *Trap Hosts* tab, verify that the *Enable traps* check box is selected and click *Add*.
. [[step3-enter-traphost-ip]]Enter the traphost IP address, and then click *OK* in the *Trap Hosts* pane.
+
The IP address of an SNMP traphost can be IPv4 or IPv6.

. When you finish adding traphosts, click *OK* in the *Edit SNMP Settings* dialog box.
