[.lead]
You can add LUN reporting nodes to help maintain optimized LUN paths.

If the volume that you move contains LUNs, and the destination aggregate is on another high-availability (HA) pair, ONTAP automatically adds an HA pair to the Selective LUN Map reporting-nodes list

.Before you begin

Two LIFs must be configured: one LIF on the destination node and the other LIF on the HA partner of the destination node.

.About this task

This procedure is required only if you move a volume from one HA pair to a different HA pair. If you move a volume to a different node of the same HA pair--for example, if you have a two-node cluster or a MetroCluster configuration--you can skip this procedure.

.Steps

. Verify that the destination node and its partner node are in the reporting-nodes list of the volume. If the nodes are not in the reporting-nodes list, add the destination node and its partner node to the reporting-nodes list of the volume:
+
`lun mapping add-reporting-nodes`
. Rescan from the host to discover the newly added paths.
. Add the new paths to your MPIO configuration.
. Remove the previous LUN owner and its partner node from the reporting-nodes list:
+
`lun mapping remove-reporting-nodes -remote-nodes -vserver vserver_name -path lun_path -igroup igroup_name`
. Rescan the host to verify removal of old paths.
+
See your host documentation for specific steps to rescan your hosts.
