If your cluster is configured for SAN, you must create SAN LIFs on the newly added nodes and then update paths.

.About this task

This procedure is required only if the cluster contains LUNs. If the cluster contains only files, you can skip this procedure.

.Steps

. For each storage virtual machine (SVM) in the cluster, create new LIFs on the newly added nodes:
 .. Identify the SVMs that use FC or iSCSI protocols by using the `vserver show` command with the `-fields allowed-protocols` parameter and reviewing the output.
+
----
cluster1::> vserver show -fields allowed-protocols
vserver allowed-protocols
------- -----------------
vs1     cifs,ndmp
vs2     fcp
vs3     iscsi
...
----

 .. For each SVM that uses FC or iSCSI, create at least two data LIFs on each of the newly added nodes by using the `network interface create` command with the `-role data` parameter.
+
----
cluster1::> network interface create -vserver vs1 -lif lif5 -role data
-data-protocol iscsi -home-node cluster1-3 -home-port e0b
-address 192.168.2.72 -netmask 255.255.255.0
----

 .. For each SVM, verify that it has LIFs on all nodes in the cluster by using the `network interface show` command with the `-vserver` parameter.
. Update portsets:
 .. Determine whether portsets exist by using the `lun portset show` command.
 .. If you want to make the new LIFs visible to existing hosts, add each new LIF to the portsets by using the `lun portset add` command--once for each LIF.
. If you use FC or FCoE, update zoning:
 .. Verify that zoning is set up correctly to enable the existing initiator ports on the host to connect to the new target ports on the new nodes.
 .. Update switch zoning to connect the new nodes to existing initiators.
+
Zoning setup varies depending on the switch that you use.

 .. If you plan to move LUNs to the new nodes, expose the new paths to the hosts by using the `lun mapping add-reporting-nodes` command.
. On all host operating systems, rescan to discover the newly added paths.
. Depending on the host operating systems, remove any stale paths.
. Add or remove paths to your MPIO configuration.
