You can quickly and nondisruptively expand an existing cluster by adding an HA pair. A larger cluster increases performance and storage capacity available in the cluster.

You should use this procedure only if the following is true:

* The existing cluster meets the following requirements:
 ** It is running ONTAP 9.
 ** It contains at least two nodes.
+
Although examples in this procedure use a two-node cluster, it also applies to clusters with more than two nodes.
+
If you want to add a node to a single-node cluster, you must follow a different procedure.

 ** It does not use IPv6 addressing or Storage Encryption.
 ** It is not a MetroCluster configuration.
* The controller modules that you plan to add meet the following requirements:
 ** If they are not new, they have been wiped clean, are no longer part of a cluster, and are ready to be added to the new cluster.
 ** They support ONTAP 9.
 ** They are running a version of the ONTAP 9 release family.
* When completing ONTAP configuration tasks with System Manager, you want to use the _Classic_ System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
