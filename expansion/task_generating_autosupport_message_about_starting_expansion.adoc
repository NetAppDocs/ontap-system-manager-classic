[.lead]
Immediately before you expand a cluster, you should send an AutoSupport message to indicate that you are about to start the expansion process. The message informs internal and external support staff about expansion and acts as a timestamp for any troubleshooting that might be required later.

.Before you begin

AutoSupport must be set up.

.Steps

. For each node in the cluster, send an AutoSupport message by using the `system node autosupport invoke` command.
