You can use System Manager to configure the node management LIF and Service Processor settings for the newly added nodes.

.Before you begin

* Sufficient number of ports must be present in the default IPspace for LIF creation.
* All the ports must be up and running.

.Steps

. Configure node management:
 .. Enter the IP address in the *IP Address* field.
 .. Select the port for node management in the *Port* field.
 .. Enter the netmask and gateway details.
. Configure Service Processor settings:
 .. Select the *Override defaults* check box to override the default values.
 .. Enter the IP address, netmask, and gateway details.
. Click *Submit and Proceed* to complete the network configuration of the nodes.
. Verify the details of the nodes in the *Summary* page.

== What to do next

* If your cluster is protected, you should create the required number of intercluster LIFs in the newly added nodes to avoid partial peering and unhealthy protection.
* If SAN data protocols are enabled in your cluster, you should create the required number of SAN Data LIFs for serving data.
