After the cluster is prepared, you must install the controllers and configure the node-management LIFs. If the controllers are not running the same ONTAP version as the existing cluster, or are repurposed and lack hardware-level HA, you must address those issues in Maintenance mode. Finally, you can join the nodes to the cluster.
