[.lead]
After you expand a cluster, you should send an AutoSupport message to indicate that the expansion process is complete. This message communicates to internal and external support staff that the expansion is complete and acts as a timestamp for any troubleshooting that might be required later.

.Before you begin

AutoSupport must be set up.

.Steps

. For each node in the cluster, send an AutoSupport message by using the `system node autosupport invoke` command.
+
You must issue the message once for each node in the cluster, including the newly added nodes.
+
If you added two nodes to a two-node cluster, you must send the message four times.
