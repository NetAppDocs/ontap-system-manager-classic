[.lead]
While adding capacity disks (HDDs) to an aggregate, you can use ONTAP System Manager classic (avaiable in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to change the RAID group to which you want to add the disks.

.About this task

* If the RAID type is RAID-DP, and if you are adding FSAS or MSATA type of disks that are equal to or larger than 10 TB in size, then you can add them only to `Specific RAID group`, and not to `New RAID group` or `All RAID groups`.
+
The disks are added after downsizing the disk size to the size of the existing aggregates.

* If the RAID group is RAID-TEC, and if you are adding FSAS or MSATA type of disks that are equal to or larger than 10 TB in size, then you can add them to `All RAID groups`, `New RAID group`, and `Specific RAID group`.
+
The disks are added after downsizing the disk size to the size of the existing aggregates.

.Steps

. Choose one of the following methods:
 ** Click *Applications & Tiers* > *Storage Tiers*.
 ** Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Aggregates*.
. In the *Storage Tiers* window, select the aggregate to which you want to add capacity disks, and then click menu:More Actions[Add Capacity].
. In the *Add Capacity* dialog box, perform the following steps:
 .. Click *Change*.
 .. In the *Change RAID Configuration* dialog box, specify the RAID group to which you want to add the capacity disks.
