= Add licenses with System Manager - ONTAP 9.7 and earlier
:icons: font

[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to add the software license if the software was not installed at the factory or if you want to add additional software licenses.

If your storage system software was installed at the factory, System Manager automatically adds the software to its list of licenses.

.Before you begin

The software license code for the specific ONTAP service must be available.

.About this task

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you use System Manager to install a NetApp License File (NLF) to enable multiple licensed features all at once. Using a NetApp License File simplifies license installation because you no longer have to add separate feature license keys. You download the NetApp License File from the NetApp Support Site.

+
For information about managing licenses, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[Manage licenses overview (cluster administrators only)^]

* When you add a new license in a MetroCluster configuration, it is a best practice to add the license on the surviving site cluster as well.
* You cannot use System Manager to add the Cloud Volumes ONTAP license.
+
The Cloud Volumes ONTAP license is not listed in the license page. System Manager does not raise any alert about the entitlement risk status of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP license.

* You can upload only capacity-based licenses.
+
The capacity-based licenses are of "`json`" type.
