[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to restore a volume to a state that is recorded in a previously created Snapshot copy to retrieve lost information. When you restore a volume from a Snapshot copy, the restore operation overwrites the existing volume configuration. Any changes that were made to the data in the volume after the Snapshot copy was created are lost.

.Before you begin

* The SnapRestore license must be installed on your system.
* If the FlexVol volume that you want to restore contains a LUN, the LUN must be unmounted or unmapped.
* There must be enough space available for the restored volume.
* Users accessing the volume must be notified that you are going to revert a volume, and that the data from the selected Snapshot copy replaces the current data in the volume.

.About this task

* If the volume that you restore contains junction points to other volumes, the volumes that are mounted on these junction points will not be restored.
* You cannot restore Snapshot copies for SnapLock Compliance volumes.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volume that you want to restore from a Snapshot copy.
. Click *More Actions* > *Manage Snapshots* > *Restore*.
. Select the appropriate Snapshot copy, and then click *Restore*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Restore*.
