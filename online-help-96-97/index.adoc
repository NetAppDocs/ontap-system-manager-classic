[.lead]
System Manager is an HTML5-based graphical management interface that enables you to manage storage systems and storage objects (such as disks, volumes, and aggregates) and perform common management tasks related to storage systems from a web browser. System Manager is included with ONTAP software as a web service, enabled by default, and accessible by using a browser. As a cluster administrator, you can use System Manager to administer the entire cluster and its resources. 

[NOTE]
====
The name of System Manager has changed from previous versions. Versions 9.5 and earlier were named OnCommand System Manager. Versions 9.6 and later are now called ONTAP System Manager.
====

System Manager enables you to perform many common tasks such as the following:

* Create a cluster, configure a network, and set up support details for the cluster.
* Configure and manage storage objects such as disks, aggregates, volumes, qtrees, and quotas.
* Configure protocols such as CIFS and NFS, and provision file sharing.
* Configure protocols such as FC, FCoE, NVMe, and iSCSI for block access.
* Create and configure network components such as subnets, broadcast domains, data and management interfaces, and interface groups.
* Set up and manage mirroring and vaulting relationships.
* Perform cluster management, storage node management, and storage virtual machine (SVM) management operations.
* Create and configure SVMs, manage storage objects associated with SVMs, and manage SVM services.
* Monitor and manage HA configurations in a cluster.
* Configure Service Processors to remotely log in, manage, monitor, and administer the node, regardless of the state of the node.
