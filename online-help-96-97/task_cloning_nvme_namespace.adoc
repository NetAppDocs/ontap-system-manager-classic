[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to quickly create another namespace of the same configuration by choosing to clone a namespace. You can map the newly cloned namespace to another host NQN.

.Before you begin

You must have a FlexClone license to clone a namespace.

.About this task

You can clone a namespace with the selected host mapping and associate it with another subsystem.

.Steps

. Click *NVMe* > *NVMe namespaces*.
. In the *NVMe namespaces window*, select the namespace you want to clone.
. You can rename the cloned namespace if you need a specific name but it is not required.
+
The dialog provides a default name of the namespace to-be-cloned.

. Modify the subsystem mapping for the cloned namespace.
. Click *OK*.
+
The online, mapped namespace is cloned inside the same SVM with a different name. Host mapping will not be cloned.
