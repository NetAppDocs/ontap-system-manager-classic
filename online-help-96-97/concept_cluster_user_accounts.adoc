[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to add, edit, and manage a cluster user account, and specify a login user method to access the storage system.

== Add a cluster user account

You can use System Manager to add a cluster user account and to specify a user login method for accessing the storage system.

.About this task

In clusters on which SAML authentication is enabled, for a particular application, you can add either SAML authentication or password-based authentication, or you can add both types of authentication.

. In the *Management* pane, click *Users*.
. Click *Add*.
. Type a user name for the new user.
. Type a password for the user to connect to the storage system, and then confirm the password.
. Add one or more user login methods, and then click *Add*.

== Edit a cluster user account

You can use System Manager to edit a cluster user account by modifying the user login methods for accessing the storage system.

.Steps

. Click *image:../media/nas_bridge_202_icon_settings_olh_96_97.gif[]*.
. In the *Management* pane, click *Users*.
. In the *Users* window, select the user account that you want to modify, and then click *Edit*.
. In the *Modify User* dialog box, modify the user login methods, and then click *Modify*.

== User accounts (cluster administrators only)

You can create, modify, lock, unlock, or delete a cluster user account, reset a user's password, or display information about all user accounts.

You can manage cluster user accounts in the following ways:

* Creating a login method for a user by specifying the user's account name, the access method, the authentication method, and, optionally, the access-control role that the user is assigned
* Displaying users' login information, such as the account name, allowed access method, authentication method, access-control role, and account status
* Modifying the access-control role that is associated with a user's login method
+
[NOTE]
====
It is best to use a single role for all the access and authentication methods of a user account.
====

* Deleting a user's login method, such as the access method or the authentication method
* Changing the password for a user account
* Locking a user account to prevent the user from accessing the system
* Unlocking a previously locked user account to enable the user to access the system again
