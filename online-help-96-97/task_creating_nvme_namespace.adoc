You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to create one or more NVMe namespaces and connect each to a host or set of hosts in a storage virtual machine (SVM). The NVMe namespace is a quantity of memory that can be formatted into logical blocks. Each namespace can be mapped to an NVMe subsystem.

.Before you begin

The SVM must already be configured with the NVMe protocol. To map a namespace, at least one LIF with the data protocol NVMe must exist in the node that owns the namespace.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *NVMe* > *NVMe namespaces*.
. Select the SVM that will contain the namespace.
. Ensure that at least one NVMe LIF is configured for each node of the HA pair. You can create a maximum of two NVMe LIFs per node.
. Configure the size of the namespace (between 1MB and 16TB).
. Enter the block size.
+
For System Manager 9.5, the block size defaults to 4 KB, and this field is not shown.
+
For System Manager 9.6, you can specify a block size of 4 KB or 512 Bytes.

. Select the existing volume or create a new volume by choosing the aggregate.
+
Click on the + symbol to set up additional namespaces (max 250) within the SVM.

. Select the NVMe subsystem that will be associated with this namespace.
+
You can choose from the following options:

 ** None: No subsystems are mapped.
 ** Use an existing subsystem: The subsystems listed are based on the selected SVM.
 ** Create a new subsystem: You can choose to create a new subsystem and map to all the new namespaces.

. Select the host operating system.
. Click *Submit*.
