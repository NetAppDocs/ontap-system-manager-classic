You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to abort a volume replication operation if you want to stop the data transfer. You can abort a scheduled update, a manual update, or an initial data transfer.

.Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the mirror and vault relationship for which you want to stop the data transfer, and then click *Operations* > *Abort*.
. Select the *Yes, I want to abort the transfer* check box to confirm the operation.
. *Optional:* Select the *Keep any partially transferred data* check box to retain the data that is already transferred to the destination volume.
. Click *Abort*.

.Results

The transfer status is displayed as "`Aborting`" until the operation is complete and displayed as "`Idle`" after the operation is complete.
