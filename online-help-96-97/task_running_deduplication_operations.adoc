You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to run deduplication immediately after creating a FlexVol volume or to schedule deduplication to run at a specified time. 

.Before you begin

* Deduplication must be enabled on the volume.
* The volume must be online and mounted.

.About this task

Deduplication is a background process that consumes system resources during the operation; therefore, it might affect other operations that are in progress. You must cancel deduplication before you can perform any other operation.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volume for which you want to run deduplication.
. Click *More Actions* > *Storage Efficiency*.
. If you are running deduplication on the volume for the first time, run deduplication on the entire volume data by selecting *Scan Entire Volume* in the *Storage Efficiency* dialog box.
. Click *Start*.
. View the last-run details of the deduplication operation in the *Storage Efficiency* tab of the *Volumes* window.
