= Edit an NVMe namespace with System Manager - ONTAP 9.7 and earlier

:icons: font

[.lead]

You can use ONTAP System Manager Classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to edit the namespace by changing the subsystem that the namespace is mapped to.

.About this task

You can only modify the NVMe subsystem settings in this window; you cannot edit the other namespace details.

.Steps

. Click *NVMe* > *NVMe namespaces*.
. In the *NVMe namespaces window*, select the namespace you want to edit.
. Select a subsystem option:
 ** None: Choosing this option unmaps the existing subsystem mapping for this namespace only. This option is preselected if no subsystem mapping is present for the selected namespace.
 ** Use an existing subsystem: This option is preselected if subsystem-to-namespace mapping is present. Choosing a different subsystem maps the new subsystem by unmapping the previously mapped subsystem.
