You can use predefined application templates in ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to create new configurations that are based on existing application templates. You can then provision instances of the application in ONTAP.

You configure applications by clicking *Applications &Tiers* > *Applications*.

[NOTE]
====
If someone adds new applications using the CLI or REST API while you are viewing the list of applications, then you will not be able to view those new applications when you scroll the list.
