[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to create a FlexClone volume when you require a writable, point-in-time copy of an existing FlexVol volume. You might want to create a copy of a volume for testing or to provide access to the volume for additional users without giving them access to the production data.

.Before you begin

* The FlexClone license must be installed on the storage system.
* The volume that you want to clone must be online and must be a non-root volume.

.About this task

The base Snapshot copy that is used to create a FlexClone volume of a SnapMirror destination is marked as busy and cannot be deleted. If a FlexClone volume is created from a Snapshot copy that is not the most recent Snapshot copy, and that Snapshot copy no longer exists on the source volume, all SnapMirror updates to the destination volume fail.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the FlexVol volume that you want to clone from the list of volumes.
. Click *More Actions* > *Clone* > *Create* > *Volume*.
. Type the name of the FlexClone volume that you want to create.
. *Optional:* If you want to enable thin provisioning for the new FlexClone volume, select *Thin Provisioning*.
+
By default, this setting is the same as that of the parent volume.

. Create a Snapshot copy or select an existing Snapshot copy that you want to use as the base Snapshot copy for creating the FlexClone volume.
. Click *Clone*.
