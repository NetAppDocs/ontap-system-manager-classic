Beginning with System Manager 9.6, you can edit the properties of an existing FlexGroup volume.

.Before you begin

The FlexGroup volume must be online.

.About this task

FabricPool FlexGroup volumes can be expanded under the following conditions:

* A FabricPool FlexGroup volume can be expanded only with FabricPool aggregates.
* A non-FabricPool FlexGroup volume can be expanded only with non-FabricPool aggregates.
* If the FlexGroup volume contains a mix of FabricPool and non-FabricPool volumes, then the FlexGroup volume can be expanded with both FabricPool and non-FabricPool aggregates.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the FlexGroup volume that you want to modify, and click *Edit*.
. *Optional:* If you want to rename the FlexGroup volume, enter the new name in the *Name* field.

Beginning with System Manager 9.6, you can also rename FlexGroup DP volumes.

This option is available only if you have enabled the Volume Encryption license and if the corresponding platform supports encryption.
