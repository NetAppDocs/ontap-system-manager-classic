[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP  9.7 and earlier) to manage LUNs.

You can access all the LUNs in the cluster by using the LUNs tab or you can access the LUNs specific to the SVM by using *SVMs* > *LUNs*.

[NOTE]
====
The LUNs tab is displayed only if you have enabled the FC/FCoE and iSCSI licenses.
