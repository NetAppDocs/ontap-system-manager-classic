[.lead]
You can use the Volumes window in ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to manage your FlexVol volumes and FlexGroup volumes. Beginning with System Manager 9.6, you can also manage FlexCache volumes.

You cannot view or manage volumes that are in storage virtual machines (SVMs) that are configured for disaster recovery by using System Manager. You must use the CLI instead.

[NOTE]
====
The command buttons and list of columns will differ based on the type of volume that is selected. You can view only those command buttons and columns that are applicable for the selected volume.
====

== Selection field

* *SVM selection pull-down menu*
+
Enables you to select all SVMs or a specific SVM to display in the list.

== Command buttons

* *Create*
+
Provides the following options:

 ** *FlexVol*
+
Opens the Create Volume dialog box, which enables you to add FlexVol volumes.

 ** *FlexGroup*
+
Opens the Create FlexGroup window, which enables you to create FlexGroup volumes.

 ** *FlexCache*
+
Opens the Create FlexCache Volume window, which enables you to create FlexCache volumes.

* *Edit*
+
Enables you to edit the properties of the selected volume.

* *Delete*
+
Deletes the selected volume or volumes.

* *More Actions*
+
Provides the following options:

 ** *Change status to*
+
Changes the status of the selected volume to one of the following statuses:

  *** Online
  *** Offline
  *** Restrict

 ** *Resize*
+
Enables you to change the size of the volume.
+
For FlexGroup volumes, you can use existing resources to resize the volumes or you can add new resources to expand the volumes.
+
For FlexCache volumes, you can also add or remove an aggregate.

 ** *Protect*
+
Opens the Create Protection Relationship window for the volumes that are selected as source.

 ** *Manage Snapshots*
+
Provides a list of Snapshot options, including the following:

  *** *Create*
+
Displays the Create Snapshot dialog box, which you can use to create a Snapshot copy of the selected volume.

  *** *Configuration Settings*
+
Configures the Snapshot settings.

  *** *Restore*
+
Restores a Snapshot copy of the selected volume.

 ** *Clone*
+
Provides a list of clone options, including the following:

  *** *Create*
+
Creates a clone of the selected volume or a clone of a file from the selected volume.

  *** *Split*
+
Splits the clone from the parent volume.

  *** *View Hierarchy*
+
Displays information about the clone hierarchy.

 ** *Storage Efficiency*
+
Opens the Storage Efficiency dialog box, which you can use to manually start deduplication or to abort a running deduplication operation. This button is displayed only if deduplication is enabled on the storage system.

 ** *Move*
+
Opens the Move Volume dialog box, which you can use to move volumes from one aggregate or node to another aggregate or node within the same SVM.

 ** *Storage QoS*
+
Opens the Quality of Service details dialog box, which you can use to assign one or more volumes to a new or existing policy group.

 ** *Change Tiering Policy*
+
Enables you to change the tiering policy of the selected volume.

 ** *Volume Encryption Rekey*
+
Changes the data encryption key of the volume.
+
The data in the volume is re-encrypted using the new key that is automatically generated. The old key is automatically deleted after the rekey operation finishes.
+
Beginning with System Manager 9.6, volume encryption rekey is supported for FlexGroup DP volumes and FlexCache volumes. Rekey is disabled for volumes that have inherited encryption from an NAE aggregate.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you initiate a volume move operation when the rekey operation of the same volume is in progress, the rekey operation is aborted. In System Manager 9.5 and earlier version, if you try to move a volume when a conversion or rekey operation of a volume is in progress, then the operation is aborted without warning. Beginning with System Manager 9.6, if you attempt a volume move during a conversion or rekey operation, a message is displayed warning that the conversion or rekey operation will be aborted if you continue.
