[.lead]
You can delete a Snapshot copy to conserve disk space or to free disk space by using ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier). You can also delete a Snapshot copy if the Snapshot copy is no longer required.

.Before you begin

If you want to delete a Snapshot copy that is busy or locked, you must have released the Snapshot copy from the application that was using the Snapshot copy.

.About this task

* You cannot delete the base Snapshot copy in a parent volume if a FlexClone volume is using that Snapshot copy.
+
The base Snapshot copy is the Snapshot copy that is used to create a FlexClone volume. The base Snapshot copy always displays the status `busy` and Application Dependency as `busy,vclone` in the parent volume.

* You cannot delete a locked Snapshot copy that is used in a SnapMirror relationship.
+
The Snapshot copy is locked and is required for the next update.

* You cannot delete a Snapshot copy from a SnapLock DP volume that is used in a SnapVault relationship before the expiry time of the Snapshot copy.
* You cannot delete the unexpired Snapshot copies (which are committed to WORM state) of a SnapLock DP volume that is in a SnapVault relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
