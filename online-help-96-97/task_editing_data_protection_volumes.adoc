You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to modify the volume name for a data protection (DP) volume. If the source volume does not have storage efficiency enabled, you might want to enable storage efficiency only on the destination volume.

.About this task

You cannot modify storage efficiency on a mirror DP volume.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select the storage virtual machine (SVM) in which the DP volume that you want to edit resides.
. Select the volume that you want to modify, and then click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit Data Protection Volume* dialog box, modify the volume name.
. Ensure the *Enable Storage Efficiency* option is selected.
+
If storage efficiency is already enabled on the volume, then the check box is selected by default.

. *Optional:* Click the *Advanced* tab, and perform the following steps:
 .. Select the caching policy that you want to assign to the volume.
 .. Select the retention priority for the cached data in the volume.

+
These options are available only for data protection FlexVol volumes in a Flash Pool aggregate.
