[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to configure an LDAP server that centrally maintains user information.

== View the LDAP client configuration

You can use System Manager to view the LDAP clients that are configured for a storage virtual machine (SVM) in a cluster.

== Use LDAP services

An LDAP server enables you to centrally maintain user information. If you store your user database on an LDAP server in your environment, you can configure your storage virtual machine (SVM) to look up user information in your existing LDAP database.

.About this task

ONTAP supports LDAP for user authentication, file access authorization, and user lookup and mapping services between NFS and CIFS.

== LDAP window

You can use the LDAP window to view LDAP clients for user authentication, file access authorization, and user search, and to map services between NFS and CIFS at the cluster level.
