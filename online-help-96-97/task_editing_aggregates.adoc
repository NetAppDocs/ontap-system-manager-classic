[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to change the aggregate name, RAID type, and RAID group size of an existing aggregate when required.

.Before you begin

For modifying the RAID type of an aggregate from RAID4 to RAID-DP, the aggregate must contain enough compatible spare disks, excluding the hot spares.

.About this task

* You cannot change the RAID group of ONTAP systems that support array LUNs.
+
RAID0 is the only available option.

* You cannot change the RAID type of partitioned disks.
+
RAID-DP is the only option that is available for partitioned disks.

* You cannot rename a SnapLock Compliance aggregate.
* If the aggregate consists of SSDs with storage pool, you can modify only the name of the aggregate.
* If the triple parity disk size is 10 TB, and the other disks are smaller than 10 TB in size, then you can select RAID-DP or RAID-TEC as the RAID type.
* If the triple parity disk size is 10 TB, and if even one of the other disks is larger than 10 TB in size, then RAID-TEC is the only available option for RAID type.

.Steps

. Choose one of the following methods:
 ** Click *Applications & Tiers* > *Storage Tiers*.
 ** Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Aggregates*.
. Select the aggregate that you want to edit, and then click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit Aggregate* dialog box, modify the aggregate name, the RAID type, and the RAID group size, as required.
. Click *Save*.
