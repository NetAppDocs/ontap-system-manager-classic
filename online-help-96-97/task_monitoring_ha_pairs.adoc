[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to monitor the node status and interconnect status of all of the high-availability (HA) pairs in a cluster. You can also verify whether takeover or giveback is enabled or has occurred, and view the reasons why takeover or giveback is not currently possible.

.Steps

. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster* > *High Availability*.
. In the *High Availability* window, click the HA pair image to view details such as the cluster HA status, node status, interconnect status, and hardware model of each node.
+
If the cluster management LIF or the data LIFs of a node are not in their home node, a warning message is displayed indicating that the node has some LIFs that are not in the home node.
