[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (avaiable in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to nondisruptively move a FlexVol volume to a different aggregate or a different node for capacity utilization and improved performance.

.Before you begin

If you are moving a data protection volume, data protection mirror relationships must be initialized before you move the volume.

.About this task

* When you move a volume that is hosted on a Flash Pool aggregate, only the data that is stored in the HDD tier is moved to the destination aggregate.
+
The cached data that is associated with the volume is not moved to the destination aggregate. Therefore, some performance degradation might occur after the volume move.

* You cannot move volumes from a SnapLock aggregate.
* You cannot move volumes from an SVM that is configured for disaster recovery to a FabricPool-enabled aggregate.

.Steps

. Choose one of the following methods:
 ** Click *Applications & Tiers* > *Storage Tiers*.
 ** Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Aggregates*.
. Select the aggregate that contains the volume, and then click menu:More Actions[Volume Move].
. Type or select information as prompted by the wizard.
. Confirm the details, and then click *Finish* to complete the wizard.
