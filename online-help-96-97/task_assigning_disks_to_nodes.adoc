[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to assign ownership of an unassigned disk to a specific node to increase the capacity of an aggregate or storage pool.

.About this task

* You can assign disks if the following conditions are true:
 ** The container type of the selected disks must be "`unassigned`".
 ** The disks must be connected to nodes in an HA pair.
 ** The disks must be visible to the node.
* For MetroCluster configurations, you cannot use System Manager to assign disks.
+
You must use the command-line interface instead.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Disks*.
. In the *Disks* window, select the *Inventory* tab.
. Select the disks that you want to assign, and then click *Assign*.
. In the *Assign Disks* dialog box, select the node to which you want to assign the disks.
. Click *Assign*.
