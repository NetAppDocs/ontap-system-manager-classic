Beginning with System Manager 9.6, you can perform a switchback operation that restores control to the original MetroCluster site (Site B) after the system has completed a successful switchover operation.

.Before you begin

Before you perform a switchback operation, you must complete the following tasks:

* You must prepare the MetroCluster sites by xref:task_performing_negotiated_planned_switchover.adoc[Performing a negotiated (planned) switchover] or xref:task_performing_unplanned_switchover.adoc[Performing an unplanned switchover].
* If errors occurred during the healing operation, you must follow the displayed instructions to fix them.
* If the state of the remote site is displayed as "`Getting ready for switchback`", then the aggregates are still resynchronizing. You should wait until the status of the remote site indicates that it is ready for switchback.

.About this task

If a switchover operation is successful, the MetroCluster Switchover and Switchback Operations window displays. The window shows the status of both sites and provides a message that tells you the operation was successful.

.Steps

. Click *Switchback from Site A to Site B* to initiate the switchback operation.
+
A warning message tells you that the switchback operation is returning MetroCluster control to Site B and that the process might take some time.

. If you want to proceed, click *Yes*.
. Perform one of the following substeps when the switchback process has completed:
 ** If the switchback operation is successful, click *Done* to acknowledge the completion of MetroCluster operations.
+
[NOTE]
====
Until you acknowledge the completion of the switchback operation, System Manager continues to display a message that the operation has completed. You cannot initiate another operation or monitor subsequent switchover or switchback operations until you acknowledge the completion of the switchback operation.
====

 ** If the switchback operation is not successful, error messages display at the top of the status area. Make corrections if needed, and click *Switchback from Site A to Site B* to retry the process.
