= Delegate administration to SVM administrators with System Manager - ONTAP 9.7 and earlier

[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to optionally delegate the administration of the SVM to SVM administrators after setting up a functional storage virtual machine (SVM) or SVMs with basic network configuration. 

.About this task

SVM administrators cannot use System Manager to manage delegated SVMs. Administrators can manage them only by using the command-line interface (CLI).

.Steps

. In the *Administrator Details* section, set up a password for the `vsadmin` user account.
. If you want a dedicated LIF for SVM management, select *Create a LIF for SVM management*, and then specify the network details.
+
A dedicated SVM management LIF is required for SAN protocols, where data and management protocols cannot share the same LIF. SVM management LIFs can be created only on data ports.

. Specify the network details, including subnet details, for creating iSCSI LIFs:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Then...
a|
Specify the IP address by using a subnet
a|

 .. Select *Using a subnet*.
 .. In the Add Details dialog box, select the subnet from which the IP address must be assigned.
+
For intercluster LIFs, only the subnets that are associated with the selected IPspace are displayed.

 .. If you want to assign a specific IP address to the interface, select *Use a specific IP address*, and then type the IP address.
+
The IP address that you specify is added to the subnet if the IP address is not already present in the subnet range.

 .. Click *OK*.

a|
Specify the IP address manually without using a subnet
a|

 .. Select *Without a subnet*.
 .. In the Add Details dialog box, perform the following steps:
  ... Specify the IP address and the network mask or prefix.
  ... Optional: Specify the gateway.
  ... If you do not want to use the default value for the Destination field, specify a new destination value.
+
If you do not specify a custom value, the Destination field is populated with the default value based on the family of the IP address.
+
If a route does not exist, a new route is automatically created based on the gateway and destination.
 .. Click *OK*.

|===

. Specify a port for creating a data LIF:
 .. Click *Browse*.
 .. Select a port from the Select Network Port or Adapter dialog box.
 .. Click *OK*.

.Results

The `vsadmin` account is unlocked and configured with the password.

The default access methods for the `vsadmin` account are ONTAP API `(ontapi)` and SSH `(ssh)`. The SVM administrator can log in to the storage system by using the management IP address.

== What to do next

You must assign aggregates to the SVM by using the Edit Storage Virtual Machine dialog box.

[NOTE]
====
If the SVM does not have any assigned aggregates, the SVM administrator cannot create volumes.
