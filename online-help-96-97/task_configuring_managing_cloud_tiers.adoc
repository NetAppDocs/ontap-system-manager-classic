[.lead]
You can use System Manager to add a cloud tier to an SSD aggregate or a virtual machine disk (VMDK) aggregate. Cloud tiers provide storage for infrequently used data.

.Before you begin

* You must have the access key ID and secret key to connect to the object store.
* You must have created a bucket inside the object store.
* Network connectivity must exist between the cluster and the cloud tier.
* If communication between the cloud tier and the cluster is encrypted using SSL or TLS, the required certificates must be installed.

.About this task

The following object stores can be used as cloud tiers:

* StorageGRID
* Alibaba Cloud (Starting with System Manager 9.6)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Commercial Cloud Service (C2S)
* Microsoft Azure Blob storage
* IBM Cloud
* Google Cloud

[NOTE]
====

* Azure Stack, which is an on-premises Azure service, is not supported.
* If you want to use any object store as a cloud tier, other than StorageGRID, you must have the FabricPool capacity license. You can add the license by clicking *Add License*.
* If you want to use an IBM Cloud Object Storage environment (such as Cleversafe), with FabricPool, you should specify a certification authority (CA) certificate. You can specify the CA certificate by moving the *Object Store Certificate* toggle button and specifying the certificate credentials.

. Select the cloud tier that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.

== What cloud tiers and tiering policies are

Cloud tiers provide storage for infrequently accessed data. You can attach an all-flash (all-SSD) aggregate to a cloud tier to store infrequently used data. You can use tiering policies to decide whether data should be moved to a cloud tier.

You can set one of the following tiering policies on a volume:

* *Snapshot-only*
+
Moves the Snapshot copies of only those volumes that are currently not being referenced by the active file system. Snapshot-only policy is the default tiering policy.

* *Auto*
+
Moves the inactive (cold) data and the Snapshot copies from the active file system to the cloud tier.

* *Backup (for System Manager 9.5)*
+
Moves the newly transferred data of a data protection (DP) volume to the cloud tier.

* *All (starting with System Manager 9.6)*
+
Moves all data to the cloud tier.

* *None*
+
Prevents the data on the volume from being moved to a cloud tier.

== What inactive (cold) data is

Infrequently accessed data in a performance tier is known as inactive (cold) data. By default, data that is not accessed for a period of 31 days becomes inactive.

Inactive data is displayed at the aggregate level, cluster level, and volume level. The inactive data for an aggregate or a cluster is displayed only if inactive scanning is complete on that aggregate or cluster. By default, inactive data is displayed for FabricPool-enabled aggregates and SSD aggregates. Inactive data is not displayed for FlexGroups.

== Cloud Tier window

You can use System Manager to add, edit, and delete cloud tiers and to view cloud tier details.

The Cloud Tier window displays the total number of licensed cloud tiers in the cluster, the licensed space that is used in the cluster, and the licensed space that is available in the cluster. The Cloud Tier window also displays the unlicensed cloud capacity that is used.

=== Command buttons

* *Add*
+
Enables you to add a cloud tier.

* *Attach Aggregates*
+
Enables you to attach aggregates to a cloud tier.

* *Delete*
+
Enables you to delete a selected cloud tier.

* *Edit*
+
Enables you to modify the properties of a selected cloud tier.

=== Details area

You can view detailed information about cloud tiers such as the list of cloud tiers, the details of the object stores, the aggregates used, and the used capacity.

If you create a cloud tier other than Alibaba Cloud, Amazon AWS S3, AWS Commercial Cloud Service (C2S), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure Blob storage, or StorageGRID by using the command-line interface (CLI), this cloud tier is displayed as Others in System Manager. You can then attach aggregates to this cloud tier.
