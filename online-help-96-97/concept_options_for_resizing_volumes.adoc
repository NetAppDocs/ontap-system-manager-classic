You can use the Volume Resize wizard in ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to change your volume size, adjust the Snapshot reserve, delete Snapshot copies, and dynamically view the results of your changes.

The Volume Resize wizard displays a bar graph that displays the current space allocations within the volume, including the amount of used and free space. When you make changes to the size or Snapshot reserve of the volume, this graph is updated dynamically to reflect the changes.

You can also use the *Calculate space* button to determine the amount of space that is freed by deleting selected Snapshot copies.

You can use the Volume Resize wizard to make the following changes to your volume:

* *Change the volume size*
+
You can change the total volume size to increase or decrease storage space.

* *Adjust Snapshot reserve*
+
You can adjust the amount of space reserved for Snapshot copies to increase or decrease storage space.

* *Delete Snapshot copies*
+
You can delete Snapshot copies to reclaim volume space.
+
[NOTE]
====
Snapshot copies that are in use cannot be deleted.
====

* *Autogrow*
+
You can specify the limit to which the volume can be grown automatically, if required.
