[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to stop a storage virtual machine (SVM) if you want to troubleshoot any issue with the SVM, delete the SVM, or stop data access from the SVM.

.Before you begin

All the clients connected to the SVM must be disconnected.

[NOTE]
====
If any clients are connected to the SVM when you stop it, data loss might occur.
====

.About this task

* You cannot stop SVMs during storage failover (SFO).
* When you stop the SVM, an SVM administrator cannot log in to the SVM.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *SVMs*.
. Select the SVM that you want to stop, and then click *Stop*.

.Results

The SVM stops serving data to clients.
