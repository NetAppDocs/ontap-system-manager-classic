ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) associates a type with every disk. ONTAP reports some disk types differently than the industry standards; you should understand how ONTAP disk types map to industry standards to avoid confusion.

When ONTAP documentation refers to a disk type, it is the type used by ONTAP unless otherwise specified. _RAID disk types_ denote the role that a specific disk plays for RAID. RAID disk types are not related to ONTAP disk types.

For a specific configuration, the disk types that are supported depend on the storage system model, the shelf type, and the I/O modules that are installed in the system.

The following tables show how ONTAP disk types map to industry standard disk types for the SAS and FC storage connection types, and for storage arrays.
