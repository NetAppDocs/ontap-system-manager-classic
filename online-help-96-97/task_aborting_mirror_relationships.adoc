.Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the relationship for which you want to stop the data transfer, and click *Operations* > *Abort*.
. Click the *Yes, I want to abort the transfer* check box to confirm the operation.
. Click the *Keep any partially transferred data* check box to retain the data that is already transferred to the destination volume.
. Click *Abort*.

The transfer status is displayed as "`Aborting`" until the operation is complete and displayed as "`Idle`" after the operation is complete.
