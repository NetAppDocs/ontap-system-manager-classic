[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to create a FlexClone file, which is a writable copy of a parent file. You can use these copies to test applications.

.Before you begin

* The file that is cloned must be part of the active file system.
* The FlexClone license must be installed on the storage system.

.About this task

* FlexClone files are supported only for FlexVol volumes.
+
You can create a FlexClone file of a parent file that is within a volume by accessing the parent file from the volume in which it resides, not from the parent volume.

* You cannot create a FlexClone file on a SnapLock volume.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volume in which you want to create a FlexClone file from the list of volumes.
. Click *More Actions* > *Clone* > *Create* > *File*.
. In the *Create FlexClone File* dialog box, select the file that you want to clone, and then specify a name for the FlexClone file.
. Click *Clone*.

.Results

The FlexClone file is created in the same volume as the parent file.
