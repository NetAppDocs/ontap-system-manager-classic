[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to delete a FlexVol volume when you no longer require the data that a volume contains or if you have copied the data that a volume contains to another location. When you delete a volume, all the data in the volume is destroyed, and you cannot recover that data.

.Before you begin

The following conditions must exist before you delete a FlexVol volume:

* The volume must be unmounted and must be in the offline state.
* FlexClone volumes must be either split from the parent volume or destroyed if the FlexVol volume is cloned.
* The SnapMirror relationships must be deleted if the volume is in one or more SnapMirror relationships.

.About this task

You should be aware of the following limitations when deleting a FlexVol volume:

* You can delete a complete SnapLock Enterprise volume or a file in a SnapLock Enterprise volume; however, you cannot delete only the data within a file in a SnapLock Enterprise volume.
* You cannot delete a SnapLock Compliance volume if data is committed to the volume.
* If the FlexVol contains both qtrees and volumes, the qtrees appear as directories. You should be careful to not delete the qtrees accidentally when deleting volumes.
* If you have associated FlexCache volumes with an origin volume, then you must delete the FlexCache volumes before you can delete the origin volume.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select the storage virtual machine (SVM) in which the volume that you want to delete resides.
. Select the volumes that you want to delete.

[NOTE]
====
