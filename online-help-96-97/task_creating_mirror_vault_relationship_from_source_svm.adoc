= Create a mirror and vault relationship from a source SVM with System Manager - ONTAP 9.7 and earlier

[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to create a mirror and vault relationship from the source storage virtual machine (SVM). Creating this relationship enables you to better protect your data by periodically transferring data from the source volume to the destination volume. This relationship also enables you to retain data for long periods by creating backups of the source volume.

.Before you begin

* The source cluster must be running ONTAP 8.3.2 or later.
* The SnapMirror license must be enabled on the source cluster and destination cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
-   For some platforms, it is not mandatory for the source cluster to have the SnapMirror license enabled if the destination cluster has the SnapMirror license and Data Protection Optimization \(DPO\) license enabled.
-   After the DPO license is enabled on the destination cluster, you must refresh the browser of the source cluster to enable the `Protect` option.
====

* The source cluster and destination cluster must be in a healthy peer relationship.
* The source SVM and destination SVM must be in a healthy peer relationship, or the destination SVM must have permission to peer.
* The destination aggregate must have space available.
* The source aggregate and the destination aggregate must be 64-bit aggregates.
* FlexVol volumes must be online and of type read/write.
* The SnapLock aggregate type must be the same.
* A maximum of 25 volumes can be protected in one selection.
* If you are connecting from a cluster running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier to a remote cluster on which Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled, password-based authentication must be enabled on the remote cluster.

.About this task

* System Manager does not support a cascade relationship.
+
For example, a destination volume in a relationship cannot be the source volume in another relationship.

* If encryption is enabled on the source volume and the destination cluster is running a version of ONTAP software earlier than ONTAP 9.3, then encryption is disabled on the destination volume by default.
* SVMs that are peered only for FlexCache applications and do not have peering permissionsforSnapMirror applications are not shown in the list of SVMs in this task. You can use the ONTAP System Manager 9.6 enhanced peering workflow to give permission to, or peer to, these SVMs. You then can select them in this task to create a protection relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. From the drop-down menu in the *SVM* field, select *All SVMs*.
. Select the volumes for which you want to create mirror and vault relationships, and then click *More Actions* > *Protect*.
+
The *Protect* option is available only for a read/write volume.

. Select the *Replication* type:

 .. *Optional:* If you do not know the replication type and relationship type, click *Help me Choose*, specify the values, and then click *Apply*.
 .. Select the relationship type.
+
The relationship type can be mirror, vault, or mirror and vault.

 .. Select a cluster and an SVM.
+
If the selected cluster is running a version of ONTAP software earlier than ONTAP 9.3, then only peered SVMs are listed. If the selected cluster is running ONTAP 9.3 or later, peered SVMs and permitted SVMs are listed.

 .. Modify the volume name suffix, if required.

 .. *Optional:* If you do not know the replication type and relationship type, click *Help me Choose*, specify the values, and then click *Apply*.
 .. Select the synchronization policy.
+
The synchronization policy can be StrictSync or Sync.

 .. Select a cluster and an SVM.
+
If the selected cluster is running a version of ONTAP software earlier than ONTAP 9.3, then only peered SVMs are listed. If the selected cluster is running ONTAP 9.3 or later, peered SVMs and permitted SVMs are listed.

 .. Modify the volume name suffix, if required.

. *Optional:* Click *image:../media/nas_bridge_202_icon_settings_olh_96_97.gif[]*, update the protection policy and protection schedule, select *FabricPool-enabled aggregate*, and then initialize the protection relationship.
. Click *Save*.
