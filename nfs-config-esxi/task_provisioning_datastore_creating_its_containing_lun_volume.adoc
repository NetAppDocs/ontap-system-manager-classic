[.lead]
A datastore contains virtual machines and their VMDKs on the ESXi host. The datastore on the ESXi host is provisioned on a volume on the storage cluster.

.Before you begin

Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere for (VSC) must be installed and registered with the vCenter Server that manages the ESXi host.

VSC must have sufficient cluster or credentials to create the volume on the specified SVM.

.About this task

VSC automates the datastore provisioning, including creating a volume on the specified SVM.

.Steps

. From the vSphere Web Client *Home* page, click *Hosts and Clusters*.
. In the navigation pane, expand the datacenter where you want to provision the datastore.
. Right-click the ESXi host, and then select *NetApp VSC* > *Provision Datastore*.
