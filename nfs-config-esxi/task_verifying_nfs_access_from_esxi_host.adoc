.Steps

. In the navigation pane, expand the datacenter to locate the datastore you previously created.
. Click *Create a new virtual machine* and provide the required information in the wizard.

To verify NFS access, you should select the datacenter, ESXi host, and datastore that you previously created.

The virtual machine appears in the vSphere Web Client inventory.
