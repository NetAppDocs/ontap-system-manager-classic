You must ensure that the ESXi host best practice settings are correct so that the ESXi host can correctly manage the loss of an NFS connection or a storage.

.Steps

. From the VMware vSphere Web Client *Home* page, click *vCenter* > *Hosts*.
. Right-click the host, and then select *Actions* > *NetApp VSC* > *Set Recommended Values*.
. In the *NetApp Recommended Settings* dialog box, ensure that all of the options are selected, and then click *OK*.

MPIO Settings do not apply to NFS. However, if you use other protocols, you should ensure that all options are selected.

The vCenter Web Client displays the task progress.
