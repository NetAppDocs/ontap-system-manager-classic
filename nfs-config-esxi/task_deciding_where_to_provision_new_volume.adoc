* If you want a new , follow the steps that you do for creating an NFS-enabled on an existing SVM.

+
You must choose this option if NFS is not enabled on an existing SVM.

* If you want to provision a volume on an existing that has NFS enabled but not configured, follow the steps that you do for configuring NFS access to an existing SVM.

This is the case if you followed this procedure to create the SVM.

* If you want to provision a volume on an existing that is fully configured for NFS access, follow the steps that you do for verifying settings on an existing SVM.
