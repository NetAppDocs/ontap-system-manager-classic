To add NFS access to an existing SVM, you must first create a data logical interface (LIF). You can then configure NFS access on the ESXi host and verify that NFS is enabled for ESXi using Virtual Storage Console.

.Before you begin

* You must know which of the following networking components the will use:
 ** The node and the specific port on that node where the data LIF will be created
 ** The subnet from which the data LIF's IP address will be provisioned, or optionally the specific IP address you want to assign to the data LIF
* Any external firewalls must be appropriately configured to allow access to network services.
* The NFS protocol must be allowed on the SVM.
+
This is the case if you did not follow this procedure to create the SVM while configuring a different protocol.

.Steps

. Navigate to the *Details* pane where you can configure the protocols of the SVM:
 .. Select the SVM that you want to configure.
 .. In the *Details* pane, next to *Protocols*, click *NFS*.

. In the *Configure NFS protocol* dialog box, create a data LIF:
 .. Assign an IP address to the LIF automatically from a subnet you specify or manually enter the address.
 .. Click *Browse* and select a node and port that will be associated with the LIF.

Do not enter any information to provision a volume. You can provision datastores later using the Virtual Storage Console.
. Click *Submit & Close*, and then click *OK*.
