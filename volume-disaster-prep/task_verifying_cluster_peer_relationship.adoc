Before you set up a volume for disaster recovery, you must verify that the source and destination clusters are peered and are communicating with each other through the peer relationship.

== Procedure

* If you are running ONTAP 9.3 or later, perform the following steps to verify the cluster peer relationship and SVM peer relationship:
 .. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster Peers*.
 .. Verify that the peered cluster is authenticated and is available.

 .. Click *Configuration* > *SVM Peers*.
 .. Verify that the destination SVM is peered with the source SVM.
* If you are running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, perform the following steps to verify the cluster peer relationship and SVM peer relationship:
 .. Click the *Configurations* tab.
 .. In the *Cluster Details* pane, click *Cluster Peers*.
 .. Verify that the peered cluster is authenticated and available.

 .. Click the *SVMs* tab and select the source SVM.
 .. In the *Peer Storage Virtual Machines* area, verify the destination SVM is peered with the source SVM.
+
If you do not see any peered SVM in this area, you can create the SVM peer relationship when creating the SnapMirror relationship.
