LUNs on the storage cluster appear to the Linux host as SCSI devices, which are I/O paths that DM-Multipath aggregates into a new device, called a multipath device. The host does not automatically discover new SCSI devices (LUNs) that you add to your system. You must manually rescan them to discover them.

.Before you begin

You must have a copy of the `rescan` script, which is in the `sg3_utils` package that is part of your Linux OS distribution.

.Steps

. Discover new SCSI devices (LUNs) and create the corresponding multipath devices for the LUNs: `/usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh`
. Verify DM-Multipath configuration:
+
`multipath -ll`
+
This displays the following type of output, listing the recommended settings for each NetApp LUN:
