If you choose to use an existing storage virtual machine (SVM), you must verify that the iSCSI service is running on the SVM.

.Before you begin

You must have selected an existing SVM on which you plan to create a new LUN.

.Steps

. Navigate to the *SVMs* window.
. Click the *SVM Settings* tab.
. In the *Protocols* pane, click *iSCSI*.
. Verify that the iSCSI service is running.

. Record the iSCSI interfaces listed for the SVM.

== What to do next

If the iSCSI service is not running, start the iSCSI service or create a new SVM.

If there are fewer than two iSCSI interfaces per node, update the iSCSI configuration on the SVM or create a new SVM for iSCSI.
